There are a total of five web programming projects requred to earn the Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp and, this submission is one of them â€” the fourth project on the course curriculum.

## About Project

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks). Don't copy this demo project.

## Here is ðŸ‘‰ [my solution]()

### User Stories:

<ol>
<li>Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"</li>
<li>You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)
</li>
<li>Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"</li>
<li>You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link
</li>
<li>When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page</li>
<li>You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"</li>
<li>Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"</li>
<li>Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address</li>
<li>The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for</li>
<li>Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section</li>
<li>The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address</li>
<li>Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"</li>
<li>When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)</li>
<li>The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport</li>
<li>Your product landing page should have at least one media query</li>
